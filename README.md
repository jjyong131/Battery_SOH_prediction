# Battery Curve Reconstruction & SOH Prediction Pipeline  
### CC (Constant-Current) + IC (Incremental Capacity) Full Deep Learning Pipeline  

---

# English Overview

This repository provides a complete machine-learning pipeline for:

- **CC Curve Reconstruction** (Residual CNN + Transformer)
- **IC Curve Generation & Reconstruction** (Gaussian smoothing + Transformer)
- **SOH (State of Health) Calculation**
- **SOH Prediction Models** (CNN + LSTM hybrid)
- Modularized scripts for CC and IC workflows

It is designed for research use on NASA battery aging datasets and supports easy extension to other batteries.

# 📦 NASA Battery Dataset (IMPORTANT)

This repository **does not include** the raw NASA battery dataset.  
You must download it manually:

🔗 NASA Battery Aging Dataset  
[https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/Battery-Aging-Dataset/uj5r-zjdb](https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/li-ion-battery-aging-datasets)

Place the files (e.g., `B0005.csv`, `B0006.csv`, …) into the `data/` directory.

# 🚀 CC Pipeline Overview

### **1) Preprocessing**
- Load CC cycle data  
- Extract input portion (e.g., 10%)  
- Normalize & split datasets  

### **2) CC Reconstruction Model**
- Residual CNN blocks + BatchNorm + ReLU  
- Optional Transformer layer  
- Hyperparameter search using KerasTuner  
- Output: Reconstructed full CC voltage curve (300 points)

### **3) SOH Merge**
- Merge CC reconstructed curves with SOH labels  
- Based on capacity retention or provided SOH data

### **4) SOH Prediction**
- CNN + LSTM hybrid model  
- Predicts SOH per cycle  
- Outputs final degradation curves

# ⚡ IC Pipeline Overview

### **1) IC Preprocessing**
- Gaussian smoothing on voltage  
- Compute dQ/dV using Gaussian derivative  
- Build long-format dataset (voltage, IC, cycle)

### **2) IC Reconstruction Model**
- Pure Transformer architecture  
- Input section: 3.90–4.00 V  
- Reconstructs the entire IC curve

### **3) IC → SOH Mapping**
- Compute SOH using capacity retention  
- Merge SOH labels per cycle  

### **4) SOH Prediction (IC-based)**
- CNN + LSTM model predicts SOH  
- Produces smooth degradation curves

## 📝 Note on NASA.py

The file **NASA.py** included in this repository is **raw experimental code written in Google Colab** during early development.  
It contains exploratory preprocessing, plotting, and experimental model tests used before the final modular pipeline was created.

- It is **not part of the final CC/IC/SOH pipeline**
- It remains in the repository for **reference and reproducibility**
- All finalized code has been refactored into:
  - `cc_preprocess.py`, `cc_reconstruct_model.py`, `cc_soh_preprocess.py`, `cc_soh_model.py`
  - `ic_preprocess.py`, `ic_reconstruct_model.py`, `ic_soh_preprocess.py`, `ic_soh_model.py`

Feel free to ignore *NASA.py* unless you want to check the raw research process.
